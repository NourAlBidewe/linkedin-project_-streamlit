842613456,The Morning Brief: White House Seeks to Limit Child Insurance Program,"The Wall Street Journal Online</br></br>The Morning Brief, a look at the day's biggest news, is emailed to subscribers by 7 a.m. every business day. Sign up for the e-mail here.</br></br>On Friday evening, with Congress out of town on its summer recess and Americans heading into a mid-August weekend, the Bush administration sent a message to the states: The federal goverment will make it tougher for a national children's insurance program to cover the offspring of middle-income families.</br></br>The State Children's Health Insurance Program was created in 1997 to help children whose families couldn't afford insurance but didn't qualify for Medicaid, and administration officials tell the New York Times that the changes are aimed at returning the program to its low- income focus and assuring it didn't become a replacement for private insurance. Administration point man Dennis Smith wrote to state officials saying there would be new restrictions on the District of Columbia and the 18 states -- including California and New York -- that extend or plan to extend coverage for children whose families make more than 250% of Federal poverty levels. For a family of three that 250% is $42,900, and for a family of four it's $51,625. Under the new limits, a child from a family making more would have to spend one year uninsured before qualifying, and any state that wants to extend coverage would have to assure Washington that at least 95% of children eligible for SCHIP or Medicaid are enrolled in one of the programs. But as the Associated Press reports, no state can currently make such assurances.</br></br>Rachel Klein, deputy director of health policy for advocacy group Families USA, tells the AP that since many families above the 250% threshold can't afford private insurance, ""the effect of this policy is to have more uninsured kids."" Ann Clemency Kohler, deputy commissioner of human services in New Jersey, tells the Times the changes ""will cause havoc with our program and could jeopardize coverage for thousands of children."" States have already been imposing waiting periods and taking other steps to prevent parents from moving their children from private insurance to SCHIP, which currently serves some 6.6 million children, the Washington Post notes. The administration's new restrictions come as the program, which expires at the end of next month if Congress doesn't reauthorize it, is the subject of a larger political fight that pits the White House against Democrats and some Republicans in Congress and state capitals."
842613457,Banking Bill Negotiators Set Compromise --- Plan to Widen Banks' Entry To Securities Business Is Dropped as Vote Nears,"WASHINGTON -- In an effort to achieve banking reform, Senate negotiators and the Bush administration have agreed to drop efforts to allow banks to expand further into the securities business.</br></br>The compromise is one of several the Senate Banking Committee is pursuing to remove obstacles its bankin bill will face when the Senate starts voting on the measure, perhaps today. The latest version of the House banking bill also drops the administration's proposals to broaden bank entry into the securities business.</br></br>Last night, the House began its second attempt to pass a banking bill after failing last week, in part because of disagreement over how to allow banks into the securities business. The House adopted on a voice vote provisions that would replenish the bank deposit insurance fund, tighten bank regulation, trim the scope of deposit insurance, and restrict the Federal Reserve Board's ability to keep sick banks alive with loans.</br></br>But the House delayed until today a vote on an amendment to allow banks to branch nationwide and on final passage of the banking bill to give the House leadership and the administration more time to drum up support for the bill.</br></br>House Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash.) is working hard to win passage of the bill in the face of significant opposition from Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), who believes the bill should include provisions imposing stiffer regulation on banks in the securities business."
842613458,Manager's Journal: Sniffing Out Drug Abusers Is No Quick Fix,"The statistics on the enormous costs of employee drug abuse are well known (at least $70 billion per year, according to December 1985 testimony before the House Labor Subcommittee on Health and Safety). Management is under pressure to reduce productivity losses, turnover, insurance costs and the risk of lawsuits for personal and property damage caused by drug-impaired workers. Management also is under sales pressure from a growing cadre of laboratories, test-kit manufacturers and consultants who extol the virtues of testing. A common argument is the following: ""Your competitors are starting to require drug tests. If you don't, their work force will be clean and you will end up with all the junkies.""</br></br>Many companies that have implemented widespread drug-testing programs, however, have learned that there is a downside to testing. They have experienced the protests of employees and civil libertarians and have watched the proliferation of lawsuits alleging invasion of privacy, defamation and other legal theories. A Texas railroad employee was awarded $200,000 in damages when his employer misreported the results of a drug test. Numerous other cases are pending.</br></br>Is there a middle ground? Can safety and efficiency be protected without invading the privacy of applicants and employees?</br></br>A growing number of companies have concluded that drug testing should be the least important part of a comprehensive drug-abuse program. The starting point is a drug-awareness program to educate managers, supervisors and employees about the dangers and signs of drug abuse. The second part of the program is an effective employee-assistance program (EAP). Rehabilitation is preferable to punishment or dismissal (at least for initial or nonserious offenses) because it encourages employees to seek help voluntarily, improves labor relations and is cost-effective by restoring valuable employees to productive status. More than one company that heedlessly adopted a ""screen and fire"" policy on drugs had second thoughts after discovering traces of drugs in some of their most productive employees.</br></br>There may be a place for drug testing in a company's drug-abuse program, but there are limits to the effectiveness of testing. To begin with, the accuracy of some drug tests varies widely, and the test results are often unacceptable even when performed by professional laboratories. Last year the Centers for Disease Control published the results of a 10-year study of laboratory testing for amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, codeine, methadone and morphine. Virtually all of the laboratories in the study had unacceptably high error rates."

""Canadian banks are relatively cautious,"" said Kevin Choquette, a Toronto analyst with Scotia Capital, the brokerage arm of Bank of Nova Scotia.</br></br>Credit problems for Canadian banks have also been milder because Canada emerged a year later than the U.S. from the last recession, Mr. Choquette added. That lag gave U.S. banks ""an extra year to put on more marginal credit,"" he said.</br></br>For the quarter ended April 30, Royal Bank, based in Toronto, said net increased 4% to 602 million Canadian dollars (US$390.8 million), or 92 Canadian cents a fully diluted share, from C$578 million, or 89 Canadian cents a share, a year earlier. Royal Bank's total provision for credit losses rose to C$210 million from C$172 million in the year-earlier period.</br></br>Results for the latest quarter included, for the first time, a full quarter of earnings for two recently acquired businesses: Dain Rauscher, a Minneapolis securities firm, and the insurance subsidiaries of South Carolina's Liberty Corp. While Dain Rauscher's results contributed to a 42% drop in Royal Bank's wealth-management earnings, the Liberty acquisitions' results fueled a 63% jump in insurance earnings. Personal- and commercial-banking earnings rose 26% to C$334 million."
842613462,Battle Over Medical Costs Isn't Over,"Many people think that the monster of health-care inflation has been licked or at least driven back into its cave. As early as July 1984, for example, then Secretary of Health and Human Services Margaret Heckler proclaimed that the Reagan administration had ""broken {its} back."" This assessment seems to be widely shared within the business community. And this July, headlines announced that ""spending on health care in 1985 rose at the lowest level in two decades."" Unfortunately, rumors about the defeat of the ""health-care monster"" may be vastly exaggerated.</br></br>How did the health-care cost spiral start? During the 1960s and 1970s the American people implicitly signed a social contract with the nation's providers of health services that was so open-ended as to be almost incredible. Under this contract, the providers would be left alone to determine how best to treat the illnesses of their patients. As compensation they were issued keys to sundry health-insurance treasuries, there to recoup whatever auditable costs they had incurred (if they were hospitals) or to fetch whatever fees they deemed ""usual, customary and reasonable"" (if they were physicians). Only very mild and generally ineffective limits were ever placed on the sums taken by individual physicians or hospitals from these insurance treasuries. Not surprisingly, prices varied widely and often capriciously among providers, and overall outlays on health care climbed.</br></br>This benificent contract was written at a time when most experts thought the nation was short of both doctors and hospital beds, so that health-care providers largely dictated the terms of the contract. Inevitably, however, the very generosity of the deal drew into the medical profession legions of educated baby-boomers eager to do well by doing good. By the late 1970s, an erstwhile sellers' market had thus transformed itself into a buyers' market with surplus capacity all around.</br></br>More than two-thirds of all health services or products are paid at point of service, not by the patient, but by some third party -- either a private insurance carrier or the public sector. As early as the late 1970s, these third-party payers began attempting to control escalating health-care costs. After Ronald Reagan's election in 1980, a two-pronged attack was made upon the health-cost monster.</br></br>The first came from the business community, which pays for about a third of all health-care expenditures through employer-paid health-insurance premiums. It sought to control the rise in its premiums by forcing employees to share a greater proportion of their health-care bills at point of consumption, and by encouraging them to join so-called Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs) or Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs). Under a PPO a business firm (and/or its insurance carrier) seeks price concessions from a limited set of doctors and hospitals who render care on a fee-for-service basis. In return for these price concessions, the firm offers its employees financial inducements to seek health care only from providers within the PPO network. Under the HMO contract, a network of physicians and hospitals contracts to provide a firm's employees all necessary health care in return for a flat, prepaid annual fee. The HMO thus has every incentive to minimize the costs of treating patients."
842613463,Sequenom to Buy Gemini Genomics In Stock Accord,"Sequenom Inc., a genomics-based biotechnology company, said it will acquire Gemini Genomics PLC of the United Kingdom in a stock swap valued at about $226.8 million, one of the first in what analysts expect to be a series of consolidations among genomics companies.</br></br>The deal combines two companies that are already working together closely in the search for human diseases linked to genetic defects. Both companies also reaped tremendous rewards by making initial public offerings during the 2000 biotech stock-market boom -- and both have also seen their stock prices plummet since then.</br></br>Sequenom, of San Diego, makes systems for sifting through genetic data in order to pinpoint meaningful genetic differences that might be linked to disease. Gemini, of Cambridge, England, has focused on amassing large databases of genetic data from twins, disease-affected families and participants in drug trials. The two companies struck a research partnership last June, one that has already produced tentative gene candidates linked to heart disease.</br></br>Under the terms of the agreement, Gemini shareholders will receive 0.2 share of Sequenom in exchange for each share of Gemini stock. Sequenom sharess dropped 11% on news of the deal, and as of 4 p.m. traded at $15.75, down $1.93, on the Nasdaq Stock Market.</br></br>Analysts generally applauded the deal, which they suggest is a harbinger of things to come among genomics firms and so-called platform companies, which build systems for processing and analyzing genetic data."

We believe the economy has still got another year of growth in it.""</br></br>Loan Pricing, a private firm that sells data on the commercial loan market, cited higher interest rates on junk bonds as one factor that is causing more borrowers to turn to short-term bank loans.

842613470,"Net Worth, Not Income, Is Right Measure of Inequality","According to Kevin A. Hassett and Aparna Mathur's(op-ed, Oct. 25), analyses showing growing inequality in the U.S. err by focusing largely ""on pretax incomes while ignoring the transfer payments and spending from unemployment insurance, food stamps, Medicaid and other safety-net programs."" The authors tell us that in measuring inequality, we should look to consumption rather than pretax cash income. This, allegedly, is because consumption ""will be set by consumers with an eye on their lifetime incomes.""</br></br>Oh, really? How about single parents, pensioners or enlisted military personnel who resort to payday loans? Their consumption is set with an eye on their immediate, pressing needs, not their lifetime incomes.</br></br>The authors seem to think that inequality can be measured by the quantity of washing machines or microwaves in poor homes. They don't consider debt levels. They seem unacquainted with foreclosures. They show no interest in future prospects.</br></br>Most remarkable of all, the authors would undo the very basis of the equality, such as it is, that they perceive in America. The safety net? Trash it, or at least ""reshape"" it.</br></br>So I guess what Mr. Hassett and Ms. Mathur really believe is that if the extent of inequality isn't so bad after all--how silly of we liberals to think otherwise.

842613471,The Americas: Ecuador Struggles Toward a Dollar Economy,"OTAVALO, Ecuador -- The long black braid, the blinding white cotton trousers and the woven shoes of the local businessmen here are visible reminders of this community's tenacious cultural pride. But it is at the markets, brimming with traditionally designed wool sweaters, bags, hammocks and wall hangings -- all crafted on imported looms -- that the Otavaleno's much-touted entrepreneurial savvy is on display. Behind the walls of many humble homes in this town, substantial inventories of those same products are bound for markets in Colombia, Chile, Venezuela, Europe and the U.S.</br></br>Located two hours north of Quito by car, on a winding and rutty road, this is said to be the only indigenous community -- of about 40 -- in the country never to have been brought under the control of the Spanish conquistadors. Ergo, instead of the stereotypical Indian poverty and isolation, the dignified Otavaleno is renowned for his independence and worldliness.</br></br>There is one thing, however, that Otavalenos share with this country's other Indian groups, mestizos and Europeans: profound economic suffering at the hands of the perniciously politicized Ecuadoran central bank. Since August 1998 the country's currency, known as the sucre, has lost 80% of its value in dollar terms, destroying savings and living standards; 1999 gross domestic product contracted 26.6% in dollar terms. Inflation, which in 1999 was more than 60%, is forecast to reach 90% in 2000.</br></br>Things are so bad here that even Ecuador's politicians, notorious fans of the central bank as an inexhaustible source of generosity, have caught on. This explains how it is that on Tuesday the Ecuadoran Congress narrowly passed a law mandating that within 180 days the central bank's dollar reserves will be used to retire the paper sucres currently in circulation -- at a rate of 25,000 to one. The new law marks the end of the central bank's power to print money and the beginning of economic hope for 12 million Ecuadorans.</br></br>Yet, it is still only hope. The law grossly perverts the term dollarization in order to preserve specific discretionary central-bank powers such as setting reserve requirements and interest rates and the ability to intervene in the markets through the use of repurchase agreements. The central bankers, it would seem, harbor a deep-seated desire to manipulate monetary outcomes even in the absence of a domestic currency system. This is absurd, but it is also illustrative in that it dramatically defines the core problems of the country: The central bankers, along with this country's other privileged elite, are dug in so hard that nonsense becomes law at their behest. Prying their hands off the economy and moving toward liberalization will mean a long, hard fight, well beyond the simple dollar-for-sucres exchange."

An index reading between zero and minus 33 indicates growth, but at slower rates than the historical average of 5%.

Lee Hamilton (D., Ind.), vice chairman of the panel.</br></br>""I would -- with the knowledge we had at the particular times as things evolved,"" the Fed chairman replied.</br></br>Members of Congress from both parties and the Bush administration recently have intensified their criticism of the Fed for not lowering interest rates aggressively enough. The last rate reduction was made in December, and there was nothing in the chairman's remarks to indicate whether the Fed plans any further moves on interest rates."
842613477,They're Writing the Checks; Ray Lane and Matthew Rogers on the new energy math for venture capitalists,"Venture capitalists never know for sure which energy innovations will succeed, but they've learned a lot about what it takes to give them a chance. The Wall Street Journal's Kimberley A. Strassel discussed the makings of a successful venture with Ray Lane, managing partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, and Matthew Rogers, a McKinsey & Co. director and former senior adviser to the secretary of energy for Recovery Act implementation.</br></br>Here are edited excerpts of their conversation.</br></br>MS. STRASSEL: People have come to understand over the past year or two that sometimes energy projects are incredibly capital-intensive, a billion dollars sometimes to create a plant, and sometimes it's going to take seven or eight or years to build one of those. How does a venture-capital market evaluate the risk of that, and do they have the patience and time to do those kinds of investments?</br></br>MR. ROGERS: You're going to have to think through how you deal with existing infrastructure, because you're going to try and displace it in a finite market. You're going to have to understand where all the capital is going to come from during the life cycle, because otherwise it doesn't make sense for a venture capitalist. The idea is to take a lot of risk in an early stage and hope you have enough ownership and liquidity to get a 10X return, because you're going to have a lot of losers in the portfolio.</br></br>MS. STRASSEL: Can venture capital do this alone, though?"

842613805,Gold's Fate May Rest With Fed,"Author: Rhiannon Hoyle</br></br>The price of gold is back at record levels. But whether it can hit $1,500 in the next few months could depend on whether the U.S. Federal Reserve sticks with an ultraeasy monetary policy that is pushing down the dollar.</br></br>Right now, the Fed appears divided over the outlook for its quantitative easing program, known to the market at QE2 and scheduled to end on June 30, and the possibility of higher interest rates later this year, even if U.S. unemployment remains high.</br></br>Any fresh signs that the Fed remains concerned about the U.S. economy would boost gold, which is seen as an alternative currency and often attracts strong interest in times of economic uncertainty and unusually low or negative interest rates after adjusting for inflation, as is the case now. An even stronger signal for gold could come from an extension of the Fed's program beyond June, which for now, at least, seems likely.</br></br>But any move by the Fed to exit quantitative easing or raise interest rates faster than analysts expect would be detrimental for gold prices, which has come to rely on the U.S.'s super-loose policy. Prices may also come under pressure as investors adjust to life after QE2 and react to any signs that the U.S. economic recovery is gaining traction."

This project is part of a master course called data preprocessing. 
In most emerging economies, unemployment rates are often undervalued and neglected by governments. 
Such high rates would lead people to seek jobs that undervalue their skills or force them to seek job opportunities in outside countries. 
For this reason, we have decided to analyze LinkedIn profiles through scraping a LinkedIn API, designing and creating the database, and visualizing the extracted data. 
Our study aims to understand the job market through highlighting the skills, majors, and industries from the collected sample.
